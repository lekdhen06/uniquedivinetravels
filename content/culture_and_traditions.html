The Bhutanese king holds the title of “Druk Gyalpo” (Dragon King), symbolizing the country’s deep connection to the Drukpa Kagyu school of Buddhism.</p>
<p><strong>Dress</strong></p>

<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Dzongs are prominent architectural features in Bhutan. These fortress-monasteries serve both as religious and administrative centers. They are characterized by their massive white walls, red roofs, and intricate woodwork.
