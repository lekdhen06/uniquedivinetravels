Phurpa, Uzha, Zhabji and Ugyen Drak (Box 1)

While Guru was coming from India via Reti and Nabji villages to go at Bumthang, the demons transformed into a huge black snakes to attack Guru. Right on the spot, he had killed the snake with help of his spiritual dragger and subdued the demons. This is where you can see the mark of dragger inserted into a rock. This place popularly known as 'Phurpa Ney' (Phurpa --Spiritual Dragger; Ney - Sacred place) is now set out for resting after a steep climb from Jangbi. Name of the village Phrumzur is derived from this sacred place. Originally, name of the village is believed to be known as Phurzur (Phur-Dragger and Zur means the Ridge). But people had mispronounced it as Phrumzur whih is being called as of now. Imprint of Guru's Uzha or Hat over the rock is located 20 meter uphill above the trail below Phrumzur village. It is believed to be the sacred place for meditation of Guru. After 20 minutes walk, you reach to another sacred place called Ugyen Drak (cliff of Guru named after he crossed it) where you can see the foot imprint of Guru. It is believed that no ordinary people could cross that huge cliff. But Guru could make it and left the sign of success to symbolize himself as super human being born to earth. Thereafter, he quoted a saying- "Nabji-Korphu is the land of enlightenment; Ugyen Drak is the tract of colossal obstacle."

Kuda Penpo’s story (Box 2)

On the way to Bumthang, he arrived to Kuda where he came across a poor two old aged couples. Since Guru was very hungry he asked them for a food and served him with a simple staple food in their miserable hut although the couples didn’t know he was a Guru. Then Guru in return gave a word of blessing for these two couples and they grew very wealthy thereafter within a very short span of that brought a big surprise to their neighbours. In curiosity, neighbour inquired the old couples about the witnessing prosperity. The innocent couples have narrated the cause effect of their existing situation to the neighbours.  This couple became very rich and powerful in the village and therefore appointed as “Penpo” (local king). But the sad thing was they had no even a single child to take over their wealth and remained in big worry. Out of haste and nervousness, the couple had planned to visit to Guru and make an appeal. On a fine day, Guru Rimpoche was seen passing by their hut and instantly invited him to their hut. The innocent couple said, “after your visit every day and night has been changing for us; the wealth ( in terms of money, crop yield, cattle, horses, etc.) have grown very rapidly. We could build a good house to live in. Since two us have no one to help at present and to take over these many wealth in the future it’s a big growing burden at present and thinking about the future is another growing worries that is beyond any solution. So, to solve this problem, please convert us into the previous situation. Now we don’t need anything as two us are in the verge of ending the breath.” 
Guru laughed at them and said, “It’s nothing difficult to revert two of you into previous way of living”. Guru had then asked the old man to sit at the right handside and the old woman at either side of him and made them join for tea. Guru made duo to place their tea cups onto the mini table placed in front of him and drank the tea at a same time and ultimately said, “Hence forth, nothing could stop recede your wealth as you desire”.  Gradually, the wealth of these two old fellows were diminished and landed with nothing in the hand to make their survival. Therefore, monpas now believe that it is because of Guru who cursed them to be encircled by poverty throughout their live for rejecting the wealth that was blessed by him for these two old people.You find part of ruined stone walls of penpo’s house aside the campsite at Kuda.

-   The habitat you traverse is very attractive for tigers, leopards and sloth bear (though it is very rare to spot them, droppings and spores can be found). Once you are in the campsite, you will be welcomed by the tourism management committee. If you desire to experience hot stone bath, facility is readily available in the campsite.
-   Nabji village consists of 55 households and an approximate population of 400 people. The village is situated on a foothill above terraced fields of rice. Early in the morning, the village guide, on the way to Korphu, will take you to the local temple at Nabji. The temple of Nabji --which means 'promising' or 'oath'- harbours the stone pillar to mark the peace between Bumthang and Assam Kings. In the village you can find rock remains of a blacksmith (one of the reincarnations of Pema Lingpa). Overnight at campsite surrounded by the rice fields of Nabji.

Rangtha Ney and Zhug Thri (Box 3)

While Guru was on the way to Bumthang he arrived to a placer called Zhug Thri located at 45 minutes walking distance from campsite towards Nabji. Zhug Thri means literally the seating chair. The chair of this sacred place is made of stone where Guru Rimpoche had sat over it to relax himself after the long distance walk. While he was taking a rest he saw two angels coming to grind gold coins into flour. There he witnessed the grinding work of two angels and asked “What you really wants to do with this gold flour?” The duo replied, “This is basically to make offer as a token of gift for you, Lord”. Actually Guru knew that these two were demons who transformed themselves into angels to take his life and he had wisely replied, “Thank you very much for your kind offering, but it’s very impossible for me to carry such a bulky amount of gold flour along with me”. To his refusal, the demons had then pleaded Guru to have sexual intercourse with one of them as token of remembrance. To his acceptation, prior to having the affair, he had asked duo to first of all watch the demonstration. And began over a rock where you can see the imprint of genital organ which is about a foot deep. Observing the unconventional or extraordinary strength of Guru, the two demons were dead and immediately gold flour changed into charcoal and the ashes. Thus, the demons were subdued in this locality. 
The seating stone chair, rock that bear imprint of genital organ and the huge grinding stones are in same spot.

Korphu origin (Box 4)

Korphu is the biggest village under Korphu Geog with 79 households. It is located at the platform of a small knoll. The dialect spoken by the community is Khengkha which is commonly spoken in Zhemgang Dzongkhag.  The place was visited by the renowned treasure discoverer called Terton Pema Lingpa a Buddgist saint from Tibet in 14th century. During his visit to Korphu village, he had to face harsh weather condition with unconventional heavy hailstorm. For his safety, he had transformed into a small bird and took a refuge under a slat of small stone like cave.   The slat cave has a corn shell- like printed beneath it. It is believed that, based on this historic and sacred place of terton Pema Lingpa, name of this village was derived as “Gorphok” (Gor – means Stone; Phok – means cave) in accordance to the direct translation of their local dialect. With the inherited generations, the ordinary name Gorphok was mispronounced or misspelled by people and commonly known as Korphu as of now.  
The stone slat cave is located in the Korphu Primary school compound below the village.
